A game site where the theme of the site is panda :)
On this site there are 2 active games and one game under construction (as we were asked to do in the course)
The first game is a game of a flying panda that must not touch the sugar canes, the game has 3 levels of difficulty: easy, medium, hard.
The second game is the memory game by using colors.
The game starts at the easiest level and progresses as the player succeeds.
While playing the games, the user accumulates points and breaks personal and team records.
